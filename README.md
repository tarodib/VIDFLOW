# VidFlow
This web application is a solution for today’s big problems. These problems are “ADS”. Nowadays, every giant company wants to make as much money as they can, and of course the best way to do this, is forcing users to watch long advertisements.

**With our site, you can pay all your attention on videos and put all annoying ads in the background.**
 
VidFlow has a modern, simple look, and against other video sharing platforms, here the most important component is a great user experience.
This app creates your own library of videos, based on your watching history and of course you are able to create playlists, like videos and others.

**What would you say, if this app would let you customize colors and fonts?**

Sounds cool, right? :)
Well, we’ve added options for customizing colors and fonts throughout the whole site. We know that everyone loves setting up their own style, so this will be the first video sharing site where you will have the opportunity to choose out the color of fonts, video backgrounds or simply change the font style to a different one.

The best thing in VidFlow is that you don’t have to skip any videos you like, because the platform will contain every single video that you would watch on YouTube.
So this sounds like a YouTube copy, but it is not, although some functions are available in Youtube as  well. This app removes(partly) all ads and makes you a better, more simple way to watch your favourites.
